//collect coins to increase score
//q is quit
//to start game hit any arrow key or space

//launch game by compiling jack code and running in VM emulator.sh


//Possible increases in functionality:
    /*
    add levels
    add obstacles 
    add randomly generated coins to keep populating after all are collected
    landing pad advances level
    add larger title and maybe title screen
