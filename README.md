# nand2tetris
The nand2tetris course (https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is a course about building the computer from the first principles of a simple nand gate all the way up to a fully implemented computer. 
//The general course outline starts with building elementary logic gates of increasing complexity and eventually a CPU, then an assembler to convert Machine code to binary, then a VM translator similar to Java, then a Compiler and OS and voila, a fully functional computer. 
This course was really challenging and I learned a great deal especially in the later projects where I wrote an assembler, VMtranslator, compiler, and an OS. 
I would highly recommend it to anyone.

The course was organized into two parts. Part 1 focuses on the hardward and ends when the computer including a CPU is fully implemented.
In part two the rest of the computer was implemented. I chose to implement the assembler, VMtranslator and Compiler in python as this is the language I am most comfortable in.
These were projects 7, 8, 10 and 11. In project 9 a program was written in the computer language JACK specific to the course which we developed a compiler for. This was to ensure understanding of the language before we started to develop a compiler.
I made a basic helicopter game which could be extended into a fully fledged game.

The OS for the computer was developed in the JACK language in project 12 which included making a basic memory class, math class, keyboard and screen, and graphics and textual output. 
Once these programs were finished the computer was a fully implemented 16 bit platform which could be extended to include greater functionality.
